This project contains the source code and datasets for UCL MSc Business Analytics 24/25 elective module MSIN0221 Natural Lanaguge Processing group assignment. 

It was a collective effort by Hengyu Zhai, Sherlock (Jinrun) Pi, Xioajia Hu, Yichen He, and Zihang Bai. 

Although by the time of finishing, the event of U.S. "TikTok Refugee" entering another Chines social media platform RedNote (Xiaohongshu, 小红书) has already passed,
it was a tranding topic when we were brainstorming for this project. This project utilised NLP techniques including Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis
to explore how these new English-speaking users think about the experience of using a Chinese and Mandarin dominated platform.
